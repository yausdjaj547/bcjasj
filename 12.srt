1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,603
<i>- Previously on "Pretty Little Liars"...
- ...End up like me.</i>

2
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:09,474
Do you know who's doing this? No, but I
also know that "A" isn't playing around.

3
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:12,277
We have three hours to find out
who "A" is before "A" finds us.

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,912
This is "A's" lair.

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,315
"A" is dressed
like the black swan.

6
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,917
I don't want Aria with him
any more than you do,

7
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:22,886
but if you back him into a corner,
nobody will end up happy.

8
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,889
You're connected to Jenna
and Ian and Jason...

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,991
almost like you guys were
members of the same club.

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,426
You're under arrest.
For what?

11
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:31,261
The murder of
Alison DiLaurentis.

12
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:32,296
It's about revenge.

13
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:34,164
You deserved
everything you got.

14
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:35,465
Mona's "A."

15
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:39,067
Mona!

16
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:42,237
They think it's over. Loser
Mona's going to the nuthouse,

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:44,473
and those precious liars
are going home to sleep

18
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:46,642
with their windows open
and their doors unlocked.

19
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:48,644
Don't they know
that's what we want?

20
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,280
They found a body.
They think it's Maya.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,264
Em, you and I are the only ones

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,260
who did anything
worth talking about this summer.

23
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:15,436
Aria took some boring picture class
and Spencer went to college.

24
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,504
I took a full load at Hollis,

25
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,540
and Aria beat out
a thousands applicants

26
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,942
for a space in that
photography class.

27
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:23,010
So, how many houses
did you build?

28
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,212
Uh, I think
we finished about six.

29
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:26,546
And in poor countries,

30
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:29,149
one house is like
a home for fifty.

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,117
Okay, Miss Productive.

32
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,086
How much of your list
did you actually do?

33
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,255
Let's see...

34
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:37,690
Cooking class with Caleb.
Done.

35
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:40,260
Volunteer at the Animal
Shelter for pocket dogs...

36
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,162
<i>Wait. That exists?
Did not do.</i>

37
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:46,765
Expand my vocabulary.
"Effectuating."

38
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:50,369
Interned for Vera Wang. You got
an internship for Vera Wang?

39
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,837
Yeah, I changed my mind.

40
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:54,006
Turns out they want you
to work for free.

41
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,641
Was that a car?

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,547
Maybe for you, you're a pixie.

43
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:05,649
I've gotten
really good at this.

44
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:17,627
"Show me your boobs. 'A'."

45
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:20,964
Does Mona have a ten-year-old brother?
"A" for "annoying."

46
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,599
Are these ever gonna stop?

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,001
Eventually we'll be old news.

48
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:27,204
Yeah, and then Garrett will go on
trial and we'll be news again.

49
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,072
Or Mona will start talking
and we'll be news again.

50
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:33,042
<i>Or I'll show someone my boobs
and we'll be news again.</i>

51
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,911
Okay!

52
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:38,647
Hey, I thought
this was a party.

53
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:43,319
You know what? You're right, Em.
Welcome back.

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,154
And you're never allowed to leave
for an entire summer again.

55
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:48,423
To making it to senior year.

56
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:49,791
Hear!

57
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,592
Not all of us made it.

58
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,931
I'm sorry, Em.
I didn't mean it like that.

59
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,567
To Maya.

60
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,539
Em, you know that
we're here for you.

61
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,610
To Maya. To Maya. To Maya.

62
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,366
Hanna.

63
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:40,539
Where's Emily and Spencer?

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,108
I don't know.

65
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,911
I need an aspirin
and a trough of water.

66
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,681
- Emily?
- She's gone.

67
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,849
What do you mean she's gone?

68
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,617
I've looked everywhere.

69
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:53,529
<i>Pretty Little Liars - 3x01 - It Happened "That Night"
Original air date: 05.06.2012.</i>

Sync & corrections by into-the-light,

71
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:01,148
How could she not
remember anything?

72
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:04,985
She's totally out of it.
She's still drunk.

73
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:08,055
You don't think that she had
anything to do with this, do you?

74
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:11,024
No! She...
she can hardly stand.

75
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:13,159
How did she get here?

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,628
Hann, hand me Em's phone.

77
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,401
Em, you got a blocked call
at eleven.

78
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:24,370
Who was it? Do you remember
who you talked to?

79
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:28,540
Um... I think I remember
leaving your house,

80
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:33,645
and the next thing I know you
guys are calling me and I'm here.

81
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:37,649
- What? That can't be right.
- What is it?

82
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,219
<i>It says that at midnight
she got a call from my phone.</i>

83
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,153
You were asleep, right?

84
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:46,057
Oh, my God. Somebody
called Emily from my phone.

85
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:48,859
Somebody was in my house.
You guys, this is a set-up.

86
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,495
What was that?

87
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,900
<i>We need to get out of here.
Now.</i>

88
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,201
Come on.

89
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:04,774
If I never see another shovel
again, it'll be too soon.

90
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,077
Wait. Do we wipe it off
or something?

91
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:09,212
Do we wipe off the prints?

92
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,449
Who would do this to Emily?

93
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,852
Who would do it to Ali?

94
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:19,622
Some twisted psycho.

95
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:22,925
The only twisted psycho we know
is locked up at Radley.

96
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,463
Let's get out of here.

97
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:31,799
Everything?

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,334
Everything.

99
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:41,009
The only person who benefits from
a missing body is Ali's killer.

100
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,210
He killed Maya, too.
I know, Em.

101
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:46,446
And Garrett's gonna
rot in hell for it.

102
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:49,816
Jenna wouldn't help Garrett.

103
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:51,417
She put him in jail.

104
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,654
What about your sister?

105
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,756
She's in Philadelphia,
and as far as we know,

106
00:06:55,757 --> 00:07:00,260
the only thing she's guilty of is being
in Ali's room the night that she died.

107
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,595
There has to be someone else...

108
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:06,899
Someone we don't know
who's connected to Garrett.

109
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,090
Duck.

110
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,224
Really?

111
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,059
Get down!

112
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:40,030
It's Lucas. What is he
doing out so late?

113
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,031
Shh!

114
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,666
Hanna, he can't hear us.

115
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:05,087
What's going on?

116
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:07,789
We're leaving.
We're going to the lake house.

117
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,259
When my mom reads this note, she'll think that
we've been up there since this afternoon.

118
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,293
Em?

119
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,351
Hello?

120
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,986
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

121
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,591
I don't know how to
tell you this...

122
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,530
Were there... Any witnesses?

123
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,836
No, mom, I...
I understand.

124
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,207
Okay, bye.

125
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,647
The caretaker called it in
this morning.

126
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,449
The place is crawling
with reporters,

127
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,352
but the police
don't have any leads.

128
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,422
So we're okay.
Nobody saw us.

129
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,690
Yeah.

130
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:23,026
I'm so sorry, guys.

131
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:25,095
This is all my fault.

132
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,530
No one's blaming you.

133
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,265
Yeah, Em. Somebody
took you there

134
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,668
to make it look like
you dug up Ali's body.

135
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,171
And I made it so easy.
If I wasn't so wasted...

136
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:35,772
Em.

137
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:39,008
Last night never happened.

138
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,178
Are we sure about that?

139
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,947
We can still go to the cops.
We can tell them the truth.

140
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,384
We don't even know
what the truth is.

141
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:53,956
Okay.

142
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:56,558
We got up here
yesterday afternoon.

143
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,493
We roasted some marshmallows,

144
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:01,931
we talked about how much fun
senior year is gonna be, and...

145
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,598
We went to bed early.

146
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,703
Em?

147
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,940
I understand.

148
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:16,945
Last night never happened.

149
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,615
Ar... you okay?

150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Aria.

151
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,616
I thought
the nightmares stopped.

152
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,018
I guess they started again.

153
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,887
Hey...
You're still safe, Aria.

154
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:43,023
There's no more "A."

155
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:46,026
You were far away from
this mess last night.

156
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,162
Thank God you stayed
at Spencer's lake house.

157
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,334
Did you read this?

158
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,272
Apparently Maya found some
things that belonged to Alison.

159
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:03,010
No, no. She...
she gave everything to Jason.

160
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:05,846
Well, actually, they think
she may have kept something,

161
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,182
something that connected Garrett
to Alison's murder.

162
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:12,709
That doesn't make sense.
She would have told Emily.

163
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,148
Well, maybe that's what she was on her
way to do, but Garrett found her first.

164
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,854
Do you know what
this weekend is?

165
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:27,157
How could I forget?

166
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:31,026
Labor Day is the anniversary
of Alison's death.

167
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,895
Or...

168
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:37,166
I was about to start
a teaching job,

169
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:40,035
<i>and you thought you
might like to teach...</i>

170
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,472
Was that true, or were
you just hitting on me?

171
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:45,640
<i>Did you really play B26, or
were you just hitting on me?</i>

172
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:55,217
<i>Can we make this... our
 anniversary instead of hers?</i>

173
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:58,487
Meet me tomorrow night
at the Rosewood Grille.

174
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,656
<i>I will be the guy at the bar
reading Ulysses.</i>

175
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:04,191
You still haven't
finished that book?

176
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,193
No one has.

177
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,531
I'm just a hopeless romantic.

178
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:13,034
I thought we could
recreate the date.

179
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,737
<i>I wouldn't exactly
call it a date.</i>

180
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:18,204
We ended the night
in the bathroom.

181
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,973
I remember.

182
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:24,410
I think it went
something like... This?

183
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,614
And then I did
something like this...

184
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:12,222
Hanna?
You like this?

185
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:15,125
<i>Yeah, I love it...
For a pregnant woman.</i>

186
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,995
Is there something
I need to know?

187
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:20,164
I'd need to have sex
to get pregnant.

188
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,431
Ew! Mom,
that's gross.

189
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:25,068
<i>Well, since when did you
become a prude?</i>

190
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,369
Since you intimated
that you want to have sex.

191
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,605
Hanna... all right,
you're allowed to date,

192
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,607
but you're not...
Open for business.

193
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:34,443
Hanna... are you starting
a business, Ashley?

194
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,779
Go. Shop.

195
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,954
I was hoping a little
retail therapy

196
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,356
might take Hanna's mind
off the headlines.

197
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:50,158
Yeah, one murder
makes the news,

198
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,227
but two dead girls
and a missing body?

199
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,660
How big is your closet?

200
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:56,931
He did it, right?

201
00:13:56,932 --> 00:14:00,034
Garrett hired someone
to dig up that grave?

202
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,668
This hasn't made the papers,

203
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,705
but the prosecution had petitioned
to have the body exhumed,

204
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:07,674
but it was gone before
the judge could make his ruling.

205
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,776
I don't think
it's a coincidence.

206
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:13,312
Can I just tell you, I am so relieved that
the girls were out of town last night.

207
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,415
For once they were reading the
news instead of making it.

208
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,913
_

209
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:28,360
It was just Toby.
I'll call him back.

210
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,628
Does he like the loft?

211
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,130
Well, he comes over
to shower every day

212
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:35,533
<i>because the plumbing is broken,
so I really like the loft.</i>

213
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:45,243
We are always going to be
those girls who knew Alison.

214
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:47,378
And now Maya.

215
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,249
Hey! You know what? I could ta a
a picture and send it to you.

216
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:59,990
Look, I keep on replaying
last night in my head.

217
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:01,892
Hanna, there was
somebody in my house.

218
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,294
While we were sound asleep,
they were right there,

219
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,095
<i>they were in
the same room as us.</i>

220
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:08,264
Just as I was starting
to feel safe again.

221
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,199
I just... I really
want to turn my brain off.

222
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,403
- Can we ditch our moms and go catch a movie?
- Ohh, I can't.

223
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:16,272
I have an appointment
with Dr. Sullivan.

224
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:18,608
Oh. You're seeing her
again?

225
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,642
Yeah. A little.

226
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:23,745
But you...
Wouldn't tell her about...

227
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,414
No!

228
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:27,516
Come on, I wouldn't
do that to Emily.

229
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:31,320
Yeah, but it's not just Emily.
We were all there.

230
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,355
Hanna, we should get going.

231
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,456
Okay.

232
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:35,989
You know what,
I'll call you later.

233
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,291
Okay.

234
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:42,730
Oops.

235
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,800
Almost forgot.

236
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:54,140
You'll need to wear it
while you're on this floor.

237
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,743
We still haven't
seen any changes,

238
00:15:56,744 --> 00:16:00,112
but I'm sure she appreciates
your visits.

239
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,494
Your friend is here.

240
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,301
Can you say hello?

241
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:01,570
That was a reporter
at the door.

242
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:05,341
Whoever took Ali's body gave him
reason to start knocking again.

243
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:07,110
What did you say to him?

244
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,113
Before I slammed the door
in his face, or after?

245
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,222
You know, you made
a difference this summer, Em.

246
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:24,326
<i>And I think
Maya would have been proud.</i>

247
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,029
I know I am.

248
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,631
It was a lot easier
to pound nails in Haiti

249
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,766
than it would have been
to stay here.

250
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,200
You know, when grandma died,

251
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:37,138
I thought I would carry
that grief with me forever.

252
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,575
But time really does help...

253
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:43,945
And eventually
it stops hurting so much.

254
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,246
I'm okay, mom.

255
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:47,915
Really.

256
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:56,523
Birds, birds, birds.

257
00:17:56,524 --> 00:18:00,026
You cannot find a top this
season without feathers on it.

258
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:14,974
Are you gonna look
right through me forever?

259
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,448
Look, it's not easy
for me to get here, okay?

260
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:26,718
I have been lying to
everyone I care about for weeks,

261
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,588
and after what happened
last night, I...

262
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:37,461
I need you to understand
something.

263
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:40,330
I am not doing this for you.

264
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,766
I'm here for me.

265
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,977
I want to know what I did
to make you hate me so much.

266
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,431
Hanna?

267
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,068
Um, no.

268
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,537
No, you must have me
confused with someone else.

269
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,371
Oh, Miss Rivers, I'm sorry.

270
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,908
Your resemblance
to an old friend is uncanny.

271
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:31,345
Please don't tell
anybody that you saw me here.

272
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,180
<i>What are doing here?
What are you doing here?</i>

273
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:36,350
I volunteer a few days a month.
Quid pro quo. What?

274
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:37,551
It's your turn.

275
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,855
Look, she owes me some answers.

276
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,623
I need it to make sense.

277
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:46,593
Sense is something rarely mined
from mental illness.

278
00:19:46,594 --> 00:19:48,795
Trust me, I've spent
a lifetime trying.

279
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,097
I'm starting
to figure that out.

280
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,766
I mean, I don't think
I can keep coming back.

281
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,435
It's like she doesn't
even know that I'm here.

282
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,103
Come here.

283
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:13,697
I promise I'll get the plumbing fixed
in the loft by the end of the week.

284
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:16,157
Oh, no, it's no rush at all.

285
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,827
Really. There's...

286
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,396
There's no rush.

287
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,739
Are your parents still out?

288
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,775
Yes...

289
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,643
You know that's my shirt.

290
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:39,279
And you're never
getting it back.

291
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,314
I don't want it back.

292
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,088
You look better in it
than I do.

293
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:55,026
Mmm.

294
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:59,831
Okay, I know that
it was my idea to wait...

295
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:03,635
But right now I'm just
completely forgetting why.

296
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:16,614
You'll remember
after I put some clothes on.

297
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,454
I am so happy you guys

298
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:27,223
decided to go to
the lake house yesterday.

299
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,759
Yeah, me too.

300
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,630
I can't imagine what went through
your head when your mom called you.

301
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,601
Can we not talk about it?

302
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:42,638
Just the thought of somebody
doing that to Alison is really...

303
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,273
Of course.

304
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:48,043
Mmm.

305
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:49,911
I'll call you later.

306
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,847
Yes, please.

307
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:09,230
So let's meet up after
and go to the store together.

308
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,765
I can't. I have an appointment
with Dr. Sullivan.

309
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:15,102
<i>Can you do it? I though the point of
cooking together was being together.</i>

310
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:20,639
<i>It is. And I promise, when I get back
we will make an unforgettable dong po.</i>

311
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,775
Say it again.
No!

312
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,344
Please!
No.

313
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:27,146
Do you want me
to go to the store?

314
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,382
<i>Dong po.</i>

315
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,718
Gimme the list.

316
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,529
Even if I say his name we get sucked
into this vortex of awkwardness.

317
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,765
And my dad pretends
like he can't hear,

318
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,334
but his neck gets all red and then his
face pinches up like he's constipated.

319
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:52,469
So basically Ezra
is like Lord Voldemort.

320
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,604
Hey.
Hey.

321
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,673
Hi, Lucas.

322
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,079
He knows something.

323
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,917
I thought you said he didn't
see you guys. He didn't.

324
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:09,419
It's no coincidence that he turned
dark after the masquerade ball.

325
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,821
Jenna has that effect
on people.

326
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:16,059
Yeah, but she's been gone all
summer, and he's still Boo Radley.

327
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,862
Have you ever noticed how many
skinny brunettes go to this school?

328
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:21,631
She fits the costume.

329
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,434
Has anybody heard from Emily?

330
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:27,536
No. I left her
a bunch of messages.

331
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:28,971
Yeah, me too.

332
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,973
Hope she's okay.

333
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:08,541
Hello?

334
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,431
Help!

335
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,932
Somebody help me!

336
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Aria.

337
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:46,825
Aria, are you ok?

338
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,150
I had a panic attack.

339
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,375
Guys, I think I saw "A."

340
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,900
No, you didn't, ok?
Mona is in a straight jacket at Radley.

341
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:59,725
Yeah, I-I heard that's she's
practicaly in a coma over there.

342
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,950
Or that girl interrupted thing could
just be an act to keep her out of jail.

343
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:08,575
I mean, you know what she's
capable of... we all do.

344
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,682
Yeah, but she can't
hurt us anymore, okay?

345
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:13,617
Bitch crazy.

346
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:17,420
Don't worry, Aria. Someday
we will all have jubilation.

347
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:23,593
That was a really good
use of that word, Hann.

348
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:36,170
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

349
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,207
Yeah, I just have
one last test to study for.

350
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,643
Oh, it's a long weekend, honey.

351
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,712
You can put in hours tomorrow.
I know...

352
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:50,651
I really could use
the extra day.

353
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:53,787
Come on, a girls night out
in the city might be fun.

354
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:55,623
Like old times.

355
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:58,125
Before your sister...

356
00:25:58,126 --> 00:26:01,629
Mom, Melissa is a Hastings.

357
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,964
We bounce back like superballs.

358
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,434
Don't work too hard.

359
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,336
Okay.

360
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:12,739
Bye.
Have fun.

361
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:28,053
Aw, you gave this to me
for Mother's Day.

362
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,125
This poor girl just can't
get any peace.

363
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:36,662
Mom, I love you, but can we please
just not talk about Alison?

364
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,062
I need a break from that.

365
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,106
You know, I wouldn't
take any of it back,

366
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,808
and neither would your father.

367
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,143
<i>Are you sure
this is what you want?</i>

368
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,913
When your father and I met,
we were so young.

369
00:26:55,914 --> 00:27:00,483
But as life got
more complicated...

370
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:03,687
It was just harder for us
to find ways to compromise.

371
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,257
You're talking about me and Ezra.
We're the complication.

372
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:11,027
No. That is just one of the many
issues we couldn't agree on.

373
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:15,031
Yeah, but it's... it's the one
that drove you two apart.

374
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,766
That is absolutely not true.

375
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,735
We're just too different now.

376
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:23,973
And that's okay. I don't want to
pretend to be somebody that I'm not,

377
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:26,607
and your father
shouldn't have to either.

378
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,179
Remember when I was thirteen

379
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,349
and you took me
to that grown-up lunch

380
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,420
and you... You made me a
promise to allow me to be me.

381
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:41,188
Of course.

382
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:43,390
Mom, you're doing that.

383
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:48,295
By not shutting out Ezra, you're
allowing me to be who I want to be.

384
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:52,233
Well, I haven't exactly
welcomed him with open arms.

385
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:55,736
No. But you don't cringe
when I say his name.

386
00:27:55,737 --> 00:27:58,637
Or look constipated
like your father does.

387
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:01,507
- You noticed that too?
- Yeah.

388
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:16,221
Hey.

389
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,291
Hey.

390
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:22,260
You look great, Em.

391
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,061
You really do.

392
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,465
You look happy.

393
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:29,100
I am.

394
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:31,369
I'm sorry if I took you
away from Spencer.

395
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,238
It's a holiday weekend,
I'm sure you guys had plans.

396
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:37,040
It's okay. She's got
one last test, so...

397
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,075
- She's studying.
- Yeah.

398
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:40,176
Thanks, Angie.

399
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,648
So, when did you move upstairs?

400
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,184
I started the remodel
a few weeks ago.

401
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,953
I mean, it's still roughing it,

402
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:53,289
but I get to live for free
while I do the work.

403
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,926
And it feels really good
to be out on my own.

404
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:03,032
How's Jenna?

405
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,601
I haven't talked to her
since she left town.

406
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:10,305
Are you okay, Emily?

407
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:15,644
I don't...
I don't think I am.

408
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:17,746
It's all over the news.

409
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:20,415
What kind of a sick person
would do something like that?

410
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,320
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

411
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:54,170
How was the shrink?

412
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:56,439
It was fine.

413
00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:58,474
What do you guys talk about?

414
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,443
Stuff.

415
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:02,345
Do you talk about us?

416
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:04,246
No.

417
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,382
How can you not talk about us?

418
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,185
We're intimate.

419
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,053
We're what?

420
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:13,022
Yeah, let's just forget that.

421
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:15,024
You just said the "I" word.

422
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:16,425
You should get that.

423
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,195
<i>I have never heard a guy
say the "I" word.</i>

424
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,130
Here.

425
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,236
Well, you're saved.
It's Spencer.

426
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,206
We have to talk about
this pool thing for tomorrow.

427
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,075
Hello?

428
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,410
Is Miss Rivers available?

429
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:37,113
How'd you get my number?

430
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,282
I took a chance that Miss Rivers'
emergency contact Harvey Marin

431
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,318
<i>might, in fact, be Hanna Marin.</i>

432
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:45,221
Is something wrong with Mona?
Other than the obvious?

433
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:48,190
Is that brit humor?
Because it's not funny.

434
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:50,126
I'm sorry, I have
a very dry sense of humor.

435
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,527
Can you just cut to the chase?

436
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:53,262
Mona's making progress,

437
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:55,297
and her doctor thinks that
your visits may be helping.

438
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,233
What kind of progress?

439
00:31:57,267 --> 00:32:00,036
<i>You should come by tomorrow
and see for yourself.</i>

440
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,004
Hey.
Everything okay?

441
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,474
Spencer, I don't want to eat raw veggies
if we're hanging out in bikinis all day.

442
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,343
But chips and salsa
sounds great!

443
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:09,045
Uh, pardon?

444
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,212
Bye, Spencer.

445
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:13,049
Good night.

446
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:20,256
I spent half the summer
partying way too much.

447
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,125
I've just been so angry.

448
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,162
Em, that's understandable.

449
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,465
I can't imagine
losing someone that way.

450
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:34,303
I was at this one party
and I got so wasted

451
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:36,272
I don't even
remember being there.

452
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,207
You don't remember anything?

453
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:42,411
I really let my friends down.

454
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:45,014
You know how Spencer and
the girls feel about you.

455
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,148
Yeah, but they're like my family.

456
00:32:46,183 --> 00:32:48,350
That's why I can't stand
to disappoint them.

457
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:52,088
<i>That's what's so great about
friends... they're not your family.</i>

458
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:54,457
They accept you
for who you are.

459
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:28,057
I'm listening.

460
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:45,274
Aria, the police are here.

461
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:48,110
They want to talk to you.

462
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:53,718
We went to Spencer's lake house.

463
00:33:53,744 --> 00:33:56,744
We made a fire and Emily showed
us pictures from the trip.

464
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,369
We spent the evening
catching up.

465
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,837
It was a pretty low-key night.

466
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,341
I'll call you
when we get home. Okay.

467
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,809
Are they charging them?
No, it's just routine.

468
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,978
The girls were at
your lake house last night.

469
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,613
I don't understand
why they're being questioned.

470
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:13,082
They said it was part of
the ongoing investigation.

471
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,450
And you believe that?

472
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:17,853
Uh, excuse me.

473
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,090
Have you seen her?
Is she okay?

474
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,891
She hasn't come out yet.

475
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:24,593
Look, I get why you're here,

476
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,194
and I'm sure
she'd appreciate it,

477
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:27,763
but I think the last thing
she needs right now

478
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,965
is the police questioning her
relationship with a former teacher.

479
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:33,402
I thought we were past this.

480
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,411
Are you okay?
Do I need to talk to them?

481
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:45,479
No, I'm fine. I just
want to get out of here.

482
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,581
We could still make
our reservation.

483
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:52,085
Or maybe we could
do this another time?

484
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:57,324
I'm sure we could all
use a bite, right?

485
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:02,161
Yes. Um, let's go.

486
00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:12,037
They've had you on
a lot of medication,

487
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,773
so I don't know
if you remember,

488
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:18,577
but I've been visiting you
for a couple of weeks now.

489
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:23,749
Remember that cute doctor
from Rosewood Memorial?

490
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,050
The one who was engaged
to Spencer's sister?

491
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:31,255
Of course you do.
You're "A."

492
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:38,195
Well, he thinks my visits
have been helping you...

493
00:35:38,196 --> 00:35:42,232
So if you want,
I can keep coming back.

494
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:46,670
Is it something you want?

495
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:28,242
Could have been you
behind this glass.

496
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:32,178
The cops were so close
to pinning it on you.

497
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:36,349
I'm sorry I had to
keep calling you like that.

498
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,352
I know what you think of me...

499
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:42,623
But I swear to you,
I didn't do it.

500
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,892
All of the evidence they
have against me, it's bogus.

501
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:49,028
You said that
you would tell me the truth.

502
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:50,596
So what is it?

503
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:53,633
There's a lot
you don't know, Spencer.

504
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:56,135
<i>Some of it
you don't want to know.</i>

505
00:36:56,136 --> 00:37:00,005
Do you think there's any chance I'm
gonna get a fair trial in this town?

506
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:02,340
Everybody already thinks
I'm guilty.

507
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,676
I don't know anything
about Maya,

508
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:07,913
but I may know
who killed Alison.

509
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,417
I'm listening.

510
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:16,521
I need a lawyer, and your mom's
one of the best in the state.

511
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:19,122
<i>No. I'm not going to help you.</i>

512
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:21,792
You're not safe, Spencer,
and your friends aren't either.

513
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:23,393
You're just trying to scare me.

514
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:26,997
It's not over!
Do you hear me?

515
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,599
I know who took the body!

516
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,294
_

517
00:38:10,939 --> 00:38:12,406
I'll try one more time.

518
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,308
Why wasn't she
at the police station?

519
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:15,877
Do you think
she told 'em the truth?

520
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,346
If she told 'em the truth,
we wouldn't be standing here.

521
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,722
Em, that was me calling you.
Where have you been?

522
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,791
It's okay. If you told them the
truth, we'll figure something out.

523
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:33,760
No, I would never
do that to you guys.

524
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,729
They called all three of us
into the station.

525
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,664
Where were you?
We were so worried.

526
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,432
I didn't have my phone
with me yesterday.

527
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:41,934
And when I got home last night,
the cops were waiting for me.

528
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:44,470
But I told them everything
that we agreed on. Everything.

529
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:47,106
Then why are you so upset?
Because if it wasn't for me,

530
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,075
we wouldn't be at the wrong
place at the wrong time,

531
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,910
and it could haunt us forever.

532
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,712
Em, it's fine. Okay?
We've dealt with it.

533
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:55,480
I saw you guys
at school yesterday,

534
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:57,949
and all I could think about
was because of me...

535
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,552
<i>Because of you, nothing.
Okay? Nobody saw us,</i>

536
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:04,923
and if we just stick to our
story, we are in the clear.

537
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:09,127
I remembered something...
About that night.

538
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:22,005
That's it?
That's all you remember?

539
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,308
I found out online
that some people forget things

540
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,109
because they don't want
to remember.

541
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,678
And if this is selective,
then anything can trigger it...

542
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,513
sights, smells, sounds.

543
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:32,482
So the car that you saw,

544
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:35,151
<i>it just looked like the car from
that night, or it was the car?</i>

545
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:36,953
I don't know.

546
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,755
I started to talk towards it
because I wanted to look inside,

547
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:42,125
but... I got a text.

548
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:45,260
And the person that sent it to me
knows I don't remember what happened.

549
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:49,799
"I bet you remember me."

550
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,500
Guys, is it starting again?

551
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:54,369
No. You guys,
that's not "A."

552
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,407
Mona is "A," and she's drooling
in her bed at a nut hospital.

553
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:01,376
We don't know that for sure.

554
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:03,078
Yeah, we do.

555
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,481
I've been visiting her.

556
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:06,948
What?

557
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,184
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd think I'm crazy.

558
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:11,686
<i>Yeah.
She tried to kill you, Hanna.</i>

559
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:14,423
She's locked up in a room
with bars over her windows.

560
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:18,192
Trust me, she doesn't know
anything that happened that night.

561
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:20,728
Yeah, well, someone does.

562
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:26,167
There's something
I need to show you guys.

563
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:40,046
Ali's shrine
is right over there...

564
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:45,318
And then over here she had a row of black
hoodies all just perfectly hanging,

565
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,820
- ready for "A" to grab one and run.
- Mona.

566
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,289
Ready for Mona.

567
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,059
Yeah.

568
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,862
And there was a zombie costume
hanging on the back of that door.

569
00:40:55,863 --> 00:40:57,563
Just like the one that
attacked Ali on Halloween.

570
00:40:57,564 --> 00:41:00,432
O-okay, so you've been
coming here all summer

571
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:03,935
trying to remember
what was in this room. Why?

572
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:06,571
We have to
tell Emily the truth.

573
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:13,578
The morning after they found
Mona's body, we came back here.

574
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:16,081
Yeah, to get rid of everything.
I know. You told me.

575
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:18,650
We lied to you.

576
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:22,053
We didn't want it to be another
thing you had to worry about.

577
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:25,122
When we came back here,
it was empty.

578
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:28,425
The file cabinets,
the maps, pictures,

579
00:41:28,426 --> 00:41:31,361
Ali's diaries...
everything was gone.

580
00:41:31,362 --> 00:41:33,397
Maybe the police took it.

581
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:36,099
If the police found out what Mona knows
about us, my mom would be in jail.

582
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,400
Yeah, Ezra too.

583
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,035
So who took it?

584
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:41,037
There are things that
don't really add up.

585
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:44,273
Like Mona was with you when
"A" gave Emily that massage.

586
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:46,342
And there's no way that she
could have gotten Ian's body

587
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,977
out of the bell tower
by herself.

588
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:52,214
Wait. You're saying that you
think someone was helping her?

589
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:58,519
If the black swan
wasn't guilty of something,

590
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,487
why would she
run from you guys?

591
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:06,684
"Mona played with dolls.
I play with body parts."

592
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,019
"Game on, bitches."

593
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,155
"A."

594
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:43,035
